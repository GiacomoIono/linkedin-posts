  "content": "ChatGPT Deep Research is now available to all Plus users!\n\nTwo weeks after I got my Pro $200/month subscription ðŸ˜­ \n\nDeep Research was by far the most attractive feature of GPT Pro.\nI used it a lot and saved countless hours already.\n\nSoon after its launch, it was copied by Perplexity and included in its $20/month subscription.\n\nThen it was copied by xAI Grok, while Google already had its own version in Gemini Advanced.\n\nGPT Plus gives 10 Deep Research queries per month, which is not a lot, but already enough for most users.\nGPT Pro gives 120 queries per month, more than you'll ever need I think.\n\nNow it'll be all about who provides the best Deep Research results!\n\nSo far, I have tried GPT Pro and Perplexity and the former still wins.\n\nBut we'll see!",
