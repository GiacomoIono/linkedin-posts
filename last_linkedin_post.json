All charts were made with ChatGPT.\n\nNo Excel, no PowerPoint, no copy-pasting numbers.\n\n1. Asked GPT to find Spotify's latest financial report.\n2. Took a screenshot of the Annual Financial Summary table\n3. Uploaded screenshot in ChatGPT and asked to make a chart out of it.\n\nSure, it took me a while to chat my way through the final result, it was worth it!\n\nWould have I been faster by just copy-pasting numbers into Excel?\n\nmaybe... but what if I was dealing with a more complex table? I guess I would have given up.\n\nAI helps:\n\n-> Make existing tasks faster.\n-> Unlock tasks you would have never done otherwise.",
