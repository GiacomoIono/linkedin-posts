No custom GPTs, no Claude Projects etc.\n\nThen, I discovered thatÂ GPT-ProÂ unlocks an even more advanced model: o1-pro, with no usage limits. ğŸ¤¯\n\nAs if that wasnâ€™t enough, OpenAI droppedÂ Deep SearchÂ last week, meant to be a complete game changer.\n\nAddÂ SoraÂ andÂ OperatorÂ (via VPN), and I wasÂ sold.\n\nFirst impressions: blown away.\n\nDeep Search + o1-pro is theÂ real deal.\nIn minutes, it completed research tasks I had worked on for months.\n\nSora seems far from the mind-blowing demos we saw months ago.\nIâ€™d say itâ€™s comparable with Runway.\n\nBut, for $200/month it's virtually unlimited.\n\nTry replicating the same projects with Runway, and you'll easily spend the same amount or more. A single video project I worked on in September costed me around $70. So, all in all Sora is a good deal.\n\nOperator is also a bit underwhelming, but gives a clear idea of where Agents are heading.\n\nNot sure how long Iâ€™ll keep the subscription, but for now Iâ€™mÂ all in.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Iâ€™ll be posting someÂ real-life use casesÂ of GPT-Pro in the context of content and marketing.\n\nStay tuned!",
