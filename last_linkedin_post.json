To back up my argument, I needed a full list of subscription products from major platforms.\n\nRather than spending hours collecting data, I usedÂ Deep Research on ChatGPTÂ to generate aÂ comprehensive tableÂ with all the details.\n\nI used a short and simple prompt, no complex prompt engineering here.\n\nI quickly drafted my post, then I ran it through LinkedIn GPT.\n\nLinkedIn GPT is a custom GPT I built by uploadingÂ all my past LinkedIn posts (yes, all of them!)Â plus some content from my favorite creators.\n\nIt outputs a refined, high-impact post that still sounds likeÂ me.\n\n\nMany creators want you to buy complex templates and courses on how to automate your life with AI. But this is not the point.\n\nAI doesnâ€™t have to be complicated. If it does feel complex, youâ€™re probably doing it wrong.\n\nIt should be so simple that it becomes part of your daily workflow, as a personal assistant rather than a replacement (for now).\n\n\nHow do you use AI in your daily work? ðŸ‘‡ ",
